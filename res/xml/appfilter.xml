    <!-- Icons are themed by specifiy their activity component name and the drawable to replace it with -->

    <!-- Replace phone icon on Nexus/AOSP devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.contacts/.activities.DialtactsActivity}" drawable="ic_phone" />
    <!-- Phone on On HTC 4.0 devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.htccontacts/.DialerTabActivity}" drawable="ic_phone" />
    <!-- Phone on Sony devices -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.sonyericsson.android.socialphonebook/.DialerEntryActivity}" drawable="ic_phone" />

    <!-- Alternatively,
         Nova Launcher maintains an internal database of common system icons to theme.
         For example the :PHONE line below does the same as all the lines above.
         Note that only non-Play Store system apps are included in this, third-party apps,
         or Play Store apps such as Chrome, or Google Calendar, will not be included and
         must be themed manually.

         The advantage to using Nova's database is that it likely covers more devices/roms
         than you would otherwise, and future updates of Nova Launcher can support
         future devices/roms as well.

         The disadvantage is that other launchers do not support it and in some cases
         you may be able to update your theme for a new device before Nova Launcher is.

         If desired you can use both methods, allowing Nova to catch any you miss or your
         ComponentInfo lines to catch any that Nova misses.

    <!-- Replace system's SMS icon -->
    <item component=":SMS" drawable="ic_sms" />

    <item component=":BROWSER" drawable="ic_browser_red" />

    <!-- Give Chrome the browser icon, but in green -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.chrome/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main}" drawable="ic_chrome" />
    <!-- And Chrome Beta a jellybean icon -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.chrome.beta/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main}" drawable="ic_jellybean_green" />

    <!-- You may also replace the app drawer icon, which does not have a traditional component name -->
    <item component=":LAUNCHER_ACTION_APP_DRAWER" drawable="ic_allapps" />
    <!-- If Nova Settings > Night Mode > Drawer icon is enabled, this will be used in night mode -->
    <item component=":LAUNCHER_ACTION_APP_DRAWER_NIGHT" drawable="ic_allapps_night" />

    <!-- As of Nova Launcher 3.0, there is special support for calendar icons. You may specify a prefix
         for where Nova Launcher can find 31 drawables (ic_calendar_1, ic_calendar_2, etc). One for every
         day of the month.
         This is only for use with calendar apps. Please make your calendar icons prettyier than mine. -->
    <calendar component="ComponentInfo{com.android.calendar/.AllInOneActivity}" prefix="ic_calendar_" />

    <!-- For launchers that don't support the calendar tag, use this single icon as a fallback
         Nova will ignore "item" tags if a given component has a "calendar" tag, but other launchers will use it -->
    <item component="ComponentInfo{com.android.calendar/.AllInOneActivity}" drawable="ic_calendar" />

    <!-- You can also use Nova's :CALENDAR shortcut to theme the system calendar apps in Nova's internal database
         Note that this does not include Google Calendar as that is available on Google Play -->
    <calendar component=":CALENDAR" prefix="ic_calendar_" />
